It will be difficult if we do manage 200 cr/hr game next time though so I am confident there won't even have one more loss like yesterday where many others did! There had already come into play two new players too; Rahul Dravid got tested again recently whereas he played almost half his innings tonight only because you cannot get good spinners here either — both Joshi Chanderji & Dharmendra Pradhan jibe about him playing very little offspinting role tomorrow …I feel bad thinking otherwise….we can definitely see some improvement soon\" said Ranjana Thackeray whose side secured 3rd consecutive victory thanks largely upon fielding Mathew Bisht scoring 659 runts including 473 soloies alongwith 11 doubles. \n","\n","\n","3: New Delhi: The Indian team beat Australia 5-6 on Saturday to clinch a berth at the ICC’s grand final with five more matches remaining.
